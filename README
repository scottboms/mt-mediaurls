Version 1.0.1 - Thursday September 3 2009


MediaURLs is a free plugin for Movable Type 4.x that provides a few 
simple template tags that allow you to easily make use of multiple 
domains or subdomains to host media assets for your site such as css 
and javascript files, images, downloads or more.

The original idea for the plugin came from information on the Yahoo! 
Developer Network's "Performance" site:

http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html


Tags Provided
-------------
The plugin provides access to four new template tags which can be used 
to separate the distribution of your CSS, JS and image files. The values 
output by these template tags can be configured on the System level in 
Movable Type.

The <mt:MediaUrl> template tag is intended to be a more generic catch-all 
tag that can be used if you only want to serve your media assets from a 
single secondary domain/subdomain.

<mt:JsUrl>

<mt:CssUrl>

<mt:ImagesUrl>

<mt:MediaUrl>


Example Use
-----------
